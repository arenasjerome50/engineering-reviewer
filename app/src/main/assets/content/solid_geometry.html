<h1>Solid Geometry</h1>

<h3>Polyhedrons</h3>
<p><strong>Polyhedron </strong>is a solid whose faces are plane polygons. A regular polyhedron is a solid with all its faces identical regular polygons. There are only five regular polyhedrons, namely tetrahedron, hexahedron (cube), octahedron, dodecahedron and icosahedron. These solids are also known as<strong> Platonic solids</strong> in honor of Plato (427 - 348 B.C.).</p>

<h3>Tips:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
  <p><strong>Lateral area </strong>is the total area of the faces of the polyhedron excluding the base.  </p>  
  <li>
  <p><strong>Surface area</strong> refers to the total area of the faces of the polyhedron including the bases.  </p>  
  <li>
  <p><strong>Anchor ring </strong>or <strong>Doughnut </strong>is another term for a torus.</p>  
  <li>
  <p><strong>Rhomboid</strong> is another term of a parallelogram.  </p>  
  <li>
  <p><strong>Geoid</strong> is the actual shape of the earth although earth most of the time is regarded as a spheroid or ellipsoid.  </p>  
  <li>
  <p><strong>Cavalieri's Theorem </strong>states that solids of equal height have equal volume if sections parallel to and equidistant from their bases have equal area. This is named after <strong>Bonaventura Cavalieri </strong>(1598-1647).</p>
